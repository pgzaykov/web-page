## Bio
Hello everyone,<br> 
I was born in Plovdiv, Bulgaria, which was <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/middleeast/11105676/The-worlds-20-oldest-cities.html?frame=3043208" target="_blank">suggested</a> to be one of the oldest still inhabited cities in Europe. For the last couple of years, I have been living in Brno, Czech Republic. Most of my productive time I spend with <a href="http://aerospace.honeywell.com/" target="_blank">Honeywell</a> doing research and design of efficient models and methods for the future aerospace computing platforms.
