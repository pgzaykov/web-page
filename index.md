I am a Lead Innovation & Research Engineer at <a href="https://codasip.com/labs/" target="_blank">Codasip Labs</a>. My focus is on the next wave of innovation related to RISC-V architectures, domain-specific acceleration for AI/ML and advanced signal processing, HPC, and supported tooling. I am also responsible for creating roadmaps, leading a team, actively participating in Horizon Europe, KDT, EuroHPC projects, and interfacing with academic and industrial partners. Recruiting and on-boarding of team members.

From 2012 to 2022, I was a Lead Scientist at <a href="http://aerospace.honeywell.com/" target="_blank">Honeywell Aerospace Labs</a> where I was responsible for multiple internal and external (FP7/ H2020) projects that brought concepts to prototypes and later transitioned them to products. I was developing technical roadmaps, leading a team, generating patents and papers, architecting proof of concept designs, and actively collaborating with academia in the area of multi-cores, edge AI computing, RTOS, tools, and application customization. My contributions improved performance, guaranteed real-time properties, preserved safety, and reduced development costs.
